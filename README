Area2
-reintegration of section modules into the master project
-wood bunk and [incomplete] chipboard modules reintegrated and added to SectionEx heirarchy
-separated hardware GVL into 5 GVLs (1 for each subarea)


Area2v2
-section modules declared in MAIN
-hardware modules moved out of GVLs into Subarea PROGRAM modules
  *A21 - A26
-section modules are passed to subarea modules to be assigned hardware and called cyclically
-each subarea module is responsible for cyclically calling its own hardware and section modules
-master logic is retained in MAIN

Area2v2a
-moved conveyors to ConveyorSyncUnit as VAR_OUTPUTs
  *conveyors are no longer tied to any particular subarea, any subarea can access them

the section modules between both versions should be identical and transferable as is
