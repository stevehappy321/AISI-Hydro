Area2
-renewed attempt at reintegration of section modules into the master project
-wood bunk and [incomplete] chipboard modules reintegrated and added to Section heirarchy
-separated hardware GVL into 5 GVLs (1 for each subarea)


Area2v2
-section modules declared in MAIN
-hardware modules moved out of GVLs into Subarea PROGRAM modules
-section modules are passed to subarea modules to be assigned hardware and called cyclically
-each subarea module is responsible for cyclically calling its own hardware and section modules
-master logic is retained in MAIN

the section modules between both versions should be identical and transferrable as is
